                <label class="btnLabel">Chargeback</label>
                <button class="copyBtn">
A chargeback is a simple way to refund customers after payment issues. 
N26, with Mastercard's help, allows you to dispute transactions for problems like undelivered goods, ensuring you can recover your funds.
                </button>
            </div>
            <div class="pair">
                <label class="btnLabel">Double Charge</label>
                <button class="copyBtn">
Sometimes, you might see two charges due to technical issues or a disconnection at the payment terminal.
Rest assured, one of these charges is temporary, and your money will be returned within 12 days. 
If it doesn't happen within that time frame, we are here to help you get your money back.
                </button>
            </div>
               <div class="pair">
                <label class="btnLabel">Dispute</label>
                <button class="copyBtn">
To dispute a payment with N26, follow these steps:

-Log in to your N26 account via the app or website.
-Locate the transaction you wish to dispute in your transaction history.
-Click on the transaction to view its details.
-Select "Get Help with this transaction".
-Provide the required information and a description of the issue.
-Submit the dispute form.

N26 will then investigate the matter and, if necessary, work with Mastercard to resolve the dispute. 
Keep in mind that the resolution process can take some time, so it's essential to be patient and cooperate with any additional requests for information from N26.

                <button class="copyBtn">
If the 'Get help' button isn't visible when you choose a transaction, it means the transaction is still being authorized (reserved). 
You'll need to wait until the charge moves to the presentment stage (completed) before taking action.

            <button class="copyBtn">Thank you for feedback. If I may ask, have you contacted the merchant directly about this payment?</button>

            <button class="copyBtn">In case you will face any issue with this or the merchant does not want to cooperate or in case they are not responding
at all, then we can definitely help you and ask for a refund for you.
            </button>
            <button class="copyBtn">I understand your concerns. If you're worried about being charged again, unfortunately, we cannot block payments to specific merchants. 
In this situation, your option is to request a new card. This will deactivate your current card and provide you with a new one bearing a different card number. 
Please be aware that the new card incurs a 10-euro fee, but the standard delivery is complimentary. You can expect to receive your card within 15 working days.
            </button>
            <button class="copyBtn">Sure. Kindly note that this process has first to be reviewed by the relevant team before we have any update. 
Once we will have any update we will immediately notify you via your secure inbox. Kindly bear with me for a while.
            </button>
            <button class="copyBtn">Thank you for your patience. I want to inform you that I have already brought the matter to the attention of the relevant team and asked for a refund.</button>

I appreciate your input. It appears that the payment is currently in the "Authorization" stage, and for a dispute to be initiated, it must first reach the "Presentment" stage. 
In other words, the transaction must be completed before a refund request can be made, and at the moment, your payment is only reserved and pending for merchant to collect it.

                <button class="copyBtn">
There are three primary methods of fraud involving debit or credit cards:

1-Your card is skimmed and duplicated, which can occur when using your card at a compromised ATM designed to steal card information.
2-Your card details are acquired online, which may result from:
a. Purchasing from a deceitful website
b. Having your information intercepted during a legitimate transaction
c. Experiencing a security breach on your online shopping account
3-Your actual card is taken and utilized for making unauthorized purchases.
